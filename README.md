# Qlik-Sense-Agent
Version: 1.0.0

#### **Qlik Sense Agent in action**

Placeholder

#### **What is it?**
The Qlik Sense Agent is a solution that helps you to enforce Governance for your entire Qlik landscape and to enable Governed Self Service

----------

#### **Which challenges does it address?**
**BICC/IT**
 - If personal apps are forwarded to the BICC to productionize them, it is hard to BICC to apply the corporate governance and best practices
 - BICC is often contacted be Business Users to guide them to existing apps
 - Today the BICC doesn‘t have any chance to provision data/data models to the Business Users for Self Service scenarios
 - Everytime a user is connecting directly to a spefic data source, Corporate Security definition is lost
Local copys of corporate data create huge compliance issue

**Business Users**
 - Qlik Business Users don‘t have an overview over the content available within their entire Qlik enviroment and the given functionality
 - As a workaround some Business Users build their own apps. This sometimes leads to a shadow IT scenario
 - This is very time consuming and sometimes frustrating: Business Users typically don‘t want to reinvent the wheel (e.g. Salesforce datamodel)
 
----------

#### **Proposed solution**
 - Provide a very simple and user appealing webbased portal which guides the business user through their use cases
 - Possibility to integrate other value added services like GMS, QMC Utilities, Qlik Data Concierge, askQ, Color Styler or other mashups
 - Connect different types of solutions within 1 frontend: QlikView, Qlik Sense, Qlik NPrinting, different types of stages, non Qlik solutions

----------

#### **Supported Use Cases**
**BICC/IT**
 - Reuse existing Security Definitions while working in Self Service mode
 - Reuse Governed Content from the Global Library
 - Less effort for provisioning of governed datamodels
 - Easy to productionize Self Service Apps

**Business Users**
 - Identify existing content from the entire Qlik landscape through a metadata driven search
 - Present existing content using Business Cards
 - Self Service Process to enhance Governed Apps with personal data
 - View Apps (QlikView or Qlik Sense)
 - Request access for Apps
 - Self Service Apps are connected to governed content a could benefit from automatic data refreshes
